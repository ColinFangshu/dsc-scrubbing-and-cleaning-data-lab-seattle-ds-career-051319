    "In the previous labs, you joined the data from our separate files into a single DataFrame.  In this lab, you'll scrub the data to get it ready for exploration and modeling!\n",

    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cast columns to the appropriate data types\n",
    "* Identify and deal with null values appropriately\n",
    "* Remove unnecessary columns\n",
    "* Understand how to normalize data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll find the resulting dataset from our work in the _Obtaining Data_ Lab stored within the file `walmart_data_not_cleaned.csv`.  \n",

    "In the cells below:\n",

    "* Import pandas and set the standard alias\n",
    "* Import numpy and set the standard alias\n",
    "* Import matplotlib.pyplot and set the standard alias\n",
    "* Import seaborn and set the alias `sns` (this is the standard alias for seaborn)\n",
    "* Use the ipython magic command to set all matplotlib visualizations to display inline in the notebook\n",
    "* Load the dataset stored in the .csv file into a DataFrame using pandas\n",

    "### Numerical Data Stored as Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A common issue to check for at this stage is numeric columns that have accidentally been encoded as strings. For example, you should notice that the `list_price` column above is currently formatted as a string and contains a proceeding '$'. Remove this and convert the remaining number to a `float` so that you can later model this value. After all, your primary task is to generate model to predict the price.\n",

    "> Note: While the data spans a multitude of countries, assume for now that all prices have been standardized to USD."
